### Technical Specification for Feature Implementation

**Feature Name**: Enhanced User Authentication

**Overview**: 
Enhance the existing user authentication system by adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) and improving security logging. This feature aims to provide an additional layer of security to the application.

**Scope**: 
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enhance security logging for authentication-related events

**Estimated Time**: 10-15 hours

#### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Description**: 
Add MFA to the existing authentication process. The MFA will be implemented using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm. Users will need to set up an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to generate the TOTP.

**Tasks**:
1. **Research and Setup (2 hours)**:
   - Research existing libraries for TOTP generation and validation.
   - Choose a suitable library (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).

2. **Database Changes (2 hours)**:
   - Add necessary fields to the user table to store MFA-related information (e.g., MFA secret, MFA enabled flag).
   - Update the ORM mappings.

3. **Backend Implementation (6 hours)**:
   - Implement endpoints for:
     - Setting up MFA (generating and sharing the secret).
     - Enabling/disabling MFA.
     - Validating TOTP during login.
   - Update the authentication logic to include TOTP validation when MFA is enabled.
   - Implement error handling and user notifications for failed MFA attempts.

**Tech Stack**:
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.3.x
- Hibernate ORM 6.x
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

#### 2. Enhanced Security Logging

**Description**: 
Improve logging for all authentication-related events to provide better traceability and monitoring. This includes logging for login attempts, MFA setup, and any changes to MFA settings.

**Tasks**:
1. **Define Logging Requirements (1 hour)**:
   - Identify key events that need to be logged (e.g., successful/failed login attempts, TOTP validation failures, changes to MFA settings).
   - Define log formats and necessary information to capture for each event.

2. **Implement Logging (3 hours)**:
   - Add logging statements in the authentication flow and MFA-related endpoints.
   - Ensure logs are detailed and include user identifiers, timestamps, IP addresses, and event outcomes.
   - Configure log levels appropriately.

3. **Testing and Validation (2 hours)**:
   - Write unit tests to ensure logging works as expected.
   - Perform integration testing to validate that logs are being generated correctly and capture the necessary details.

**Tech Stack**:
- Java 21
- SLF4J for logging
- Logback for log management
- Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for logging cross-cutting concerns

### Deliverables

- Updated database schema
- Source code for backend and frontend changes
- Unit and integration tests
- Documentation for:
  - Setting up MFA as a user
  - Enabling/disabling MFA
  - Understanding the enhanced logging

### Assumptions

- The existing authentication system is based on JWT.
- The frontend is built using React 18.

### Risks and Considerations

- Ensuring backward compatibility for users who do not enable MFA.
- Potential user experience issues with MFA setup; clear instructions and error messages are critical.
- Ensuring security of the MFA secret during transmission and storage.

### Timeline

| Task                                | Time Estimate |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Research and Setup                  | 2 hours       |
| Database Changes                    | 2 hours       |
| Backend Implementation              | 6 hours       |
| Define Logging Requirements         | 1 hour        |
| Implement Logging                   | 2 hours       |
| Testing and Validation              | 2 hours       |
| **Total**                           | **15 hours**  |

The total time estimate slightly exceeds the 10-15 hour range. Consider prioritizing tasks or allocating additional time to ensure quality implementation.

This specification should serve as a comprehensive guide for implementing the enhanced user authentication feature within the specified timeframe.
